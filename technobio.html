  	<center><btitle>A LIFE MEASURED IN DEVICES</btitle></center>
  	
    <p>When I have conversations with my friends about technology, and how much it’s changed over my lifetime, I invariably find myself starting a string of exclamations with, “I’m old enough to remember when… .” I am not 80 years old. I am 26. Yet, in those 26 years, technology has progressed at a rate where I can comfortably say things like, “I’m old enough to remember not having the internet at my house.” I have realized that I mark the passing of time by technological advances rather than actual time. The walkman, to the portable CD player, to the iPod, to the iPhone. My life isn’t measured in years, it’s measured in devices. What does that say about me? What does that say about my generation?</p>
  <p>I was my parent’s first child, and a Macintosh desktop computer was their second. I had the unique experience of growing up in a home with a desktop computer before the internet was really a thing. My father was a graphic designer, which meant I learned how to use the computer in our home fairly effectively as a kid. It wasn’t until more than 10 years later that I would decide to pursue jobs as a graphic designer, but using a program called “Quark Express” was where I first tried out making art with a computer at the ripe age of 9. The computer had a floppy disk drive, and a monitor, and that was about it. I remember getting in trouble because I kept changing the screensaver. Flying toasters were my jam, no pun intended.</p>
  <p>The other great benchmark of technology within my childhood was the gloriously sacred Nintendo 64.

    <p>My family was always a few steps behind the technological curve, so while my friends were playing GameCubes and PlayStations, I was saving up enough money to buy a second-hand Nintendo 64. These platforms mark the first time in my life I recognized the technological shortcomings of my family. But, as soon I had it, it was pretty much all I wanted to do. Specifically, Tony Hawk’s Pro-Skater and 007: Goldeneye hold steadfast in my heart and mind as some of the most fun I have ever had. Playing those games with my younger brothers are memories I will treasure forever, truly.</p>

<p>Despite the jumpstart on having a desktop computer in the home, after that, my family feel behind technologically pretty quickly. A combination of conservative parents and a lack of funds contributed to my steep decline in technological advancement. We didn’t have internet in my home until I was 16 years old (2007, which is coincidentally when I got my first cellphone - it was made of rubber, couldn’t text, and was the coolest thing I owned). The first time my dad opened up the internet browser on the computer in our living room, we all gathered around to see him check his email (he used the internet for his job, just like the rest of the universe). It took all of 15 minutes for an extremely explicit pop-up to prompt him to unplug the computer, and literally leave it unplugged for the next few weeks. Those 15 minutes were pretty great.</p>
<p>After I graduated high school and moved away from home, it became pretty apparent pretty quickly that I had a fair amount of catching up to do. I devoured any and everything I could that had to do with computers, software, and social networking. I remember sitting in my college dorm and streaming Hulu for the first time. It was incredible, and I sat between a state of disbelief and wonder that I was able to watch The Office on this laptop I had bought from a friend. I took the plunge into the world of technology information and never looked back. 
Over the next few years, I became a full-forged graphic designer, bought a few new computers, learned to design and code websites, got a smart phone, and in general tried to play catch up. As I sit here, writing this essay from an iPhone, wearing and Apple Watch, and using my laptop out this on my website later, I think it's safe to say that I'm just about as current as a person can be.</p>
<p>When I think about the things that have “wowed” me in my life (at least in regards to technology), theres really only one constant among all the instances; the realization that this piece of tech is going to change the way I interact with people or the the things around me. The first thing I did when I got a Facebook account was write on one of my friends’ wall. The first thing I did when I got a smart phone was download the Skype app so I could video-chat my girlfriend who was out of town. The first thing I did when I got a smart watch was send my virtual heartbeat to that same girl (who I get to call my wife now).</p>
<p>My relationship with technology has definitely modulated over the course of my life. If you asked me point blank if it's shaped who I am, my initial response would probably be in the negative. But as I reflect, and realize that technology plays a role in most of the memories and highlights of my life, how could I say anything but yes? Technology has played an important role in my life, and I think it's done the same for pretty much everyone else. The ways we communicate with each other, whether it be via text, phone call, tweet, meme, or poke, have become extremely varied and extremely easy.</p>
