      <p>I love podcasts. I've recorded podcasts before. I'm excited to do it again.
      <p>I've been kicking around a few ideas, and I realize this is for a class, but I would love if it could turn into something I do pretty regularly. So my ideas are centered around that idea of doing something I could revisit in the future throughout multiple episodes. This has weeded out a few of the more simple, "one-off" topics, which has been helpful but also made the decision a little more difficult and complicated. I've more or less settled on two topics that interest me and that I would love to talk about in podcast form:
        <p><b>BAD ASS HISTORY: &nbsp;</b> A summation of different, lesser known moments in history that are, you guessed it, bad ass. Whether its political espionage, epic battle stories, or just people that were kind of crazy (looking at you, Andrew Jackson).
          <p><b>CONSPIRACY THEORIES FOR DAYS: &nbsp;</b> I love hearing the craziest consipracy theories, and exploring the "evidence" that supports those theories. Let's talk about aliens. Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about Walt Disney's frozen head.
            <p>Hopefully I'm able to settle on a topic soon. Either way, I am excited to start working on it.</p>

  	   <p>I recently suffered a birthday.
      <p>I say "suffered" because I'm not really a birthday guy. Yes, I survived another year, and haven't died yet. Congratulations to me, I guess.
      <p> This year, like every year in recent memory, my birthday started with a barrage of social media well wishes, congratulatory texts, and a general ceaseless buzzing of my phone pretty much as soon as I awoke. I know I should be grateful, and I honestly am. I'm just not sure how I feel about that many people being able to reach me all at once. Seems... kinda icky.
        <p> My wife likes to tell me I'm an old soul, which is fair, I guess. Don't get me wrong, I love technology, and building websites, and social media for the most part. I work professionaly as a graphic designer, and I would be lost without my MacBook or iMac. I use an iPhone 7 Plus, I wear an Apple Watch on my wrist, and generally consider myself a tech savvy person.
          <p> But for some reason, on my birthday, I wasn't really into it. Like at all.<br><br>

            <p>I definitely check social media multiple times a day, and like to stay connected to the people and world around me. Yet, on my birthday, the tweets, posts, pokes, texts, emails, instas, etc was just A LOT.
              <p>When I think of "multimodality," this is what I think about. The almost infinite ways in which people can interract with you. Obviously, these are really simple, surface levels examples, but I think it accentuates where we are as a society, and the TONS AND TONS of ways we can communicate with eachother.
                <p>I think when used with purpose and conciously, multimodality can be extremely powerful. The translation of ideas into tangible products that people can interract with is pretty much how I would describe my job as a graphic designer.
                  <p>Let's get multimodal.</p>
