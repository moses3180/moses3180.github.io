  	<btitle>BLOG POST 1</btitle>
  	<p>I recently suffered a birthday.
      <p>I say "suffered" because I'm not really a birthday guy. Yes, I survived another year, and haven't died yet. Congratulations to me, I guess.
      <p> This year, like every year in recent memory, my birthday started with a barrage of social media well wishes, congratulatory texts, and a general ceaseless buzzing of my phone pretty much as soon as I awoke. I know I should be grateful, and I honestly am. I'm just not sure how I feel about that many people being able to reach me all at once. Seems... kinda icky.
        <p> My wife likes to tell me I'm an old soul, which is fair, I guess. Don't get me wrong, I love technology, and building websites, and social media for the most part. I work professionaly as a graphic designer, and I would be lost without my MacBook or iMac. I use an iPhone 7 Plus, I wear an Apple Watch on my wrist, and generally consider myself a tech savvy person.
          <p> But for some reason, on my birthday, I wasn't really into it. Like at all.<br><br>

            <p>I definitely check social media multiple times a day, and like to stay connected to the people and world around me. Yet, on my birthday, the tweets, posts, pokes, texts, emails, instas, etc was just A LOT.
              <p>When I think of "multimodality," this is what I think about. The almost infinite ways in which people can interract with you. Obviously, these are really simple, surface levels examples, but I think it accentuates where we are as a society, and the TONS AND TONS of ways we can communicate with eachother.
                <p>I think when used with purpose and conciously, multimodality can be extremely powerful. The translation of ideas into tangible products that people can interract with is pretty much how I would describe my job as a graphic designer.
                  <p>Let's get multimodal.</p>
